What is the Parliamentary Tradition?

Ireland

S
Parliament House in Dublin in the 18th century

Dáil Éireann

‘Ireland has a tradition of parliamentary government whose roots predate the
written history of the country’ (see also pp. 162–163).
In Celtic society, legends and annals provide examples of chieftains and kings who
were elected. But it was the coming of the Normans to Ireland in 1169 that led to
the introduction of the same type of parliament as they had already established
in England. This parliament was abolished in the Act of Union, 1800. During the
19th century, campaigns for Repeal (of the Act of Union) and Home Rule fought to
bring back the parliament to Dublin.
When Sinn Féin grew in popularity after the 1916 Rising, they won the 1918
general election with a policy of abstaining from the parliament in Westminster,
and seeking greater independence for Ireland.
Sinn Féin representatives set up their own parliament in Dublin in 1919, called
the first Dáil Éireann. Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921, the
third Dáil was elected in June 1922.
Since 1922 Leinster House has been the seat of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.

Daniel O’Connell,
The Liberator
Daniel O’Connell was the most important political
leader in Ireland in the first half of the 19th century.
He was opposed to the use of violence for political
purposes. Instead he believed in working through the
laws and parliament to achieve changes.

MAKING HISTORY

O’Connell and non-violence
O’Connell was born in Co. Kerry in 1775. He
was educated at home, in Belgium, France
and in London. He witnessed scenes from the
French Revolution as he travelled through
France in 1793, at the time the King of France
was beheaded. These events made a big
impression on him. He said France was ‘deluged
(flooded) in blood; liberty (freedom) was sacrificed.’
Events in Ireland during the 1798 Rebellion
also horrified him. He said, ‘May every virtuous
revolutionist remember the horrors of Wexford!’

After his education in London, O’Connell became a famous barrister who
won many court cases. He earned the nickname, ‘The Councellor’. One of his

Q

What was Catholic

did O’Connell

What did Catholic
Emancipation mean?

How did O’Connell achieve Catholic Emancipation?

In one of the last of the penal laws, Catholics could not take their seats in
parliament, even if they were elected. O’Connell fought a long campaign to
overturn this law. In 1823, he founded the Catholic Association to lead his
campaign for Catholic Emancipation. He organised a Catholic Rent (a penny
a month) to finance the campaign. He also held peaceful meetings in both Ireland and
Britain, to put pressure on the British government.
He got elected to Clare in 1828, and this forced the government to pass the Catholic
Relief Act (1829), which allowed Catholics take their seats in parliament. O’Connell’s
fame spread far and wide, including in Europe, where many admired his peaceful
methods of achieving his goals. He became known as ‘The Liberator’.

O’Connell also achieved great fame, at home and abroad,
as an abolitionist, who wanted to abolish slavery. He
helped pass the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which
abolished slavery in the British empire. When Frederick
Douglass, a former American slave, came to Ireland in
1845, he looked on O’Connell as a hero. He said, ‘The fire
of freedom was burning in his mighty heart.’ O’Connell also
favoured Jewish emancipation.

Ireland?
3. Why would he
‘recognise [them]
as Irishmen no
longer’?
4. What points is he
making to try to
persuade them
not to support
slavery?

O’Connell wrote to the Irish Repeal
Association in Cinncinati, Ohio, in 1843
criticising their views on slavery.
How can the generous, the charitable, the humane, and the noble emotions of the
Irish heart have become extinct amongst you? How can your nature be so totally
changed as that you should become the apologists (supporters) and advocates
(promoters) of the execrable (terrible) system which makes man the property of
his fellow man, condemns to ignorance, immorality and irreligion, millions of our
fellow creatures …? It was not in Ireland that you learned this cruelty … if you
remain and dare continue to support the system of slavery that is supported there,
we will recognise you as Irishmen no longer!

The Repeal of the Act of Union
After his success in winning Catholic Emancipation, O’Connell led a campaign
to Repeal the Act of Union, so that a parliament would be established in Dublin.
He set up the Repeal Association in 1840, with Repeal Rent. ‘… I want to make all
Europe and America know it – I want to make England feel her weakness if she refuses to
give the justice we [the Irish] require – the restoration of our domestic parliament …’
He said 1843 would be the Year of Repeal. In spite of huge peaceful rallies, ‘monster
meetings’, held all over the country, his campaign failed. The British government feared
that giving Repeal to Ireland would lead to the break-up of the union of England,
Scotland and Wales. O’Connell cancelled a monster meeting at Clontarf when the
British government banned it, because he feared it would result in violence.

THE PARLIAMENTARY TRADITION IN IRISH POLITICS – Daniel O’Connell and C. S. Parnell

Charles Stewart Parnell – The ‘Uncrowned
King of Ireland’

22Investigate

the role and
significance of
C. S. Parnell

Charles Stewart Parnell was born in Co. Wicklow,
the son of an Anglo-Irish landowner in 1846.
He was the most influential Irish politician at the
end of the 19th century.

Home Rule
Parnell was elected a Home Rule MP for Meath
in 1875. Five years previously, in 1870, Isaac Butt
had founded the Home Rule movement. Home
Rulers wanted a parliament in Dublin to deal
with internal affairs in Ireland, similar to Daniel
O’Connell’s Repeal movement, 30 years before.

13

Q

What was Home
Rule?

Links with Fenians
Parnell first came to prominence in the House of Commons in Westminster in 1876
when he stated that no murder had been committed by the Manchester Martyrs. This
referred to the death of a policeman in Manchester in 1867, shot by Fenians as they
were trying to release two of their colleagues from a prison van. This brought Parnell to
the notice of the secret Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) or Fenians.
Parnell supported the policy of parliamentary obstruction, where some Irish MPs
made long speeches to obstruct the business of parliament until parliament dealt with
Irish matters. This strengthened Parnell’s ties with members of the IRB. As a result, IRB
support ensured that Parnell was elected President of the Home Rule Confederation of
Great Britain.

Q

How did Parnell
gain support from
the Fenians (IRB)?

The New Departure
John Devoy, leader of the American Fenians (IRB), proposed a ‘new departure’
in politics. He suggested that the Fenians should drop their policy of rejecting
parliamentary action. Instead, the Fenians should work with Parnell and MPs like him
to promote self-government for Ireland and land reform. This New Departure brought
the physical force tradition and the parliamentary tradition together.

The Land War
Parnell soon became involved in the land campaign. An economic crisis at the end of
the 1870s worsened conditions for tenants, and evictions increased. Parnell accepted an
invitation by Michael Davitt to speak at a meeting in Westport, Co. Mayo, in 1879. This
led to the founding of the Land League a few months later, with Parnell as President,
and Davitt as Secretary. The Land League aimed for fairer rents for tenants, and, in the
long-term, for peasant or farmer ownership of their farms.

Departure? How

THE PARLIAMENTARY TRADITION IN IRISH POLITICS – Daniel O’Connell and C. S. Parnell

13

Leader of Home Rule Party
When Isaac Butt died in 1879, one of his supporters, William Shaw, was elected leader
of the Home Rule Party. However, the 1880 general election changed everything, as
many supporters of Parnell got elected as Home Rule MPs. Parnell got elected for Cork
city and replaced Shaw as leader of the Home Rule Party.

Kilmainham Gaol and treaty
There were increased agrarian outrages (incidents, crimes) in the
countryside as a Land War between tenants and landlords broke
out. The Land League demanded that Gladstone, the British Prime
Minister, bring in land reform. He introduced the Land Act of 1881,
which provided fair rents for the tenants, and a land court to decide
the rents. Parnell favoured the Act, but publicly asked tenants to
test it in the courts. Parnell and other leaders were interned in
Kilmainham Gaol (1881).
While Parnell was in jail, there was an increase in disturbances
in the countryside. Gladstone realised that it would be better if
Parnell were released. At the end of six months, Parnell agreed the
Kilmainham Treaty (1882) with Gladstone. Gladstone improved
the Land Act, while Parnell promised that he would use his influence
to stop the violence. This led to a break between Parnell and the
Fenians. It also meant that Parnell had used outside agitation and
pressure in parliament to improve conditions for tenants.

Home Rule Bill
Parnell now concentrated on Home Rule. He re-organised the party.
He founded the Irish National League, which was organised in each
constituency. He controlled the organisation with a tight discipline.
Members now sat together in parliament and worked together as a
united group. The party paid Home Rule MPs and they had to take a
pledge or oath to vote with the party.
More people got the vote in general elections, which meant Parnell
increased his support. After the 1885 general election, Parnell and the
Home Rule Party held the balance of power in Westminster between
Liberals and Conservatives. He could have put either into government, but Parnell
supported Gladstone and the Liberal Party after Gladstone’s promise to bring in a Home
Rule Bill.
Gladstone’s Home Rule Bill (1886) provided for parliament in Dublin to deal with
internal Irish affairs, while parliament in Westminster would deal with external affairs.
However, it was defeated in the House of Commons. The Conservative Party, and some
of Gladstone’s Liberal Party, backed by unionists in the North of Ireland, combined to
defeat the Bill.

THE PARLIAMENTARY TRADITION IN IRISH POLITICS – Daniel O’Connell and C. S. Parnell

Piggott forgeries
Soon after, the London Times published letters
in articles called Parnellism and Crime. These
letters seemed to show that Parnell supported
the Phoenix Park murders, when two highranking officials in the British government were
brutally murdered by a Fenian group in 1882.
Parnell said the letters were forgeries. And so
it was proved by a Special Commission, which
showed the letters had been forged by Richard
Piggott, a journalist. Parnell’s name was cleared
and his popularity was at its highest.

MAKING HISTORY

Parnell’s downfall

Katherine O’Shea,
mistress of
C. S. Parnell

However, Parnell’s downfall came soon after because of the O’Shea
Divorce Case. Parnell had been having an affair with Katherine
O’Shea since 1880, and they had a number of children. In 1890, her
husband, Captain O’Shea, filed for divorce, and named Parnell in
the proceedings.
The divorce case provided scandal but, after it, Parnell still
retained the support of his party. The situation changed when
Gladstone said his Liberal Party could no longer bring forward a
Home Rule Bill if Parnell continued as leader of the Home Rule
party. This led to a split in the party, the majority voting against
Parnell.
After this, Parnell fought a number of by-elections in Ireland. In
the process his health deteriorated. He returned to Brighton where
he lived with Katherine O’Shea, and died there in October 1891,
aged 45. He was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery after a huge funeral
procession through the streets of Dublin.

The significance of Parnell
●●

Parnell was a very able politician who led the majority of the people in Ireland
through many difficult political situations in the late 1870s and the 1880s.

●●

Parnell was a Protestant leader and landlord, who led a Catholic tenant population.

●●

Parnell and Davitt led the Land League in the Land War, which forced Gladstone to
bring in land reform for the tenants in the 1881 Land Act.

●●

Parnell created a disciplined
political party, which others
imitated later.

●●

Parnell forced Gladstone and the
Liberal Party to bring in the First
Home Rule Bill.

●●

Parnell seemed to side with the
Fenians who wanted a completely
separate Ireland. As a result, after
his death, he was often included
in the republican or physical force
tradition, in contrast to O’Connell
who was clearly against the use of
violence or armed rising.

in 1911 to honour Parnell
