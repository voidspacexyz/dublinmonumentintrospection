THE RISE AND IMPACT OF NATIONALISM AND UNIONISM IN IRELAND, 1911–1923

15

What was Nationalism and Unionism?
At the beginning of the 20th century, Ireland was ruled directly from London. Irish
members of parliament (MPs) and lords sat in the House of Commons and House of
Lords in Westminster, London. It was here that the laws for Ireland were passed. This is
the way Ireland had been ruled since the Act of Union in 1800 (see p. 171).
The two main political groups in Ireland in 1911 were the nationalists and the
unionists. (See pp. 162–63)

22Define

Unionists

… wanted changes in the way Ireland
was ruled. They wanted some form of
self-government with a parliament in

… wanted to keep the system as it
was, with a parliament in Westminster

Unionism

The majority of unionists lived in the north-east of Ireland,
especially the counties of Antrim and Down. Other unionists were
scattered throughout the rest of Ireland. Their leaders were Edward
Carson and James Craig. Carson was an outstanding speaker,
while Craig was a very good organiser.

What was the influence of Cultural Nationalism?
Ireland went through a cultural revolution at the
end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th
century. A number of organisations and movements
promoted the idea of an Irish Ireland or Gaelic
Ireland. Even though they were not political
groups, they influenced the political thinking of
many people. Some leaders, especially those who
later led the 1916 Rising, believed that the only
way a Gaelic Ireland could be achieved was by full
Michael Cusack, founder of GAA
independence from Britain.
The groups included:
●● The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), founded in 1884 to promote Gaelic
games, including hurling and football (see Ch. 14).
●●

The Gaelic League, founded in 1893 to promote the use of the Irish
language and to de-Anglicise Ireland.

●●

The Anglo-Irish literary movement, which promoted Irish literature in the
English language using Irish folktales and history.

The Home Rule Crisis, 1912–14

Douglas Hyde, founder of
Gaelic League

Revival

Background
The Conservative Party ruled Britain from 1895 to 1906. During that time, unionists in
Ireland were happy because they knew that a Home Rule Bill would not be passed. But,
in 1906, the Liberal Party took over government. They supported Home Rule.

22Consider
the Home
Rule Crisis,
1912–14

The Parliament Act, 1911
In 1910, after two elections, the Liberals needed the support of the Home Rule Party
to stay in government (power). The Liberals also passed a new law in 1911 – the
Parliament Act. Up to this, the House of Lords could vote against (and defeat) Bills
coming from the House of Commons. Now under the Parliament Act, the House of
Lords could delay laws for only two years.
With the Liberals depending on the Home Rule Party and with the power of the
House of Lords weakened, Home Rule for Ireland seemed likely.

The Third Home Rule Bill, 1912
The Liberal Party had tried to pass two Home Rule bills in the 19th century. Both of these
had been defeated. In 1912, the Liberals, led by Prime Minister Asquith, introduced the
Third Home Rule Bill. According to this bill:
●● A parliament in Dublin would deal with internal Irish affairs.
●●

The parliament in Westminster would deal with external affairs.

MAKING HISTORY

The Unionist Party and the Conservatives were opposed to the bill, but the House of
Lords could not delay the bill for more than two years. So Home Rule would become
law in 1914.

Unionist opposition
The unionist leaders, Carson and Craig, believed that if they opposed the bill strongly
enough, the British government would be forced to drop it. They began to organise
strong opposition to the bill.

Nationalist reaction
Nationalists also organised themselves. In November 1913, Eoin MacNeill, Professor
of History at University College, Dublin, wrote an article called ‘The North Began’. He
suggested that nationalists should follow the example of the Northern unionists and
form their own Volunteer force. This would put pressure on the British government to
bring in Home Rule.

The threat of civil war
At this time, the Third Home Rule Bill was making its progress through the British
parliament at Westminster. Attempts at compromise or agreement between nationalists
and unionists failed. It looked as if Ireland was heading for civil war.
But the crisis came to a sudden end. On 4 August 1914, Britain declared war on
Germany. World War I had begun. The Home Rule Bill became law on 18 September,
but it was immediately suspended and not revived until 1919.

Reaction to World War I
Nationalist Split
The Irish Volunteers split over Ireland’s part in World War I. The vast majority of the
Irish Volunteers followed the views of John Redmond, leader of the Home Rule Party.
These became known as the National Volunteers. Redmond said Irishmen should take
part in the war to defend Home Rule.

Unionists in Northern Ireland
Unionists, north and south, joined the British army to take part in the war. In the north,
Carson asked the Ulster Volunteer Force to ‘answer immediately his Majesty’s call’ to arms.
In some places, Irish Volunteers and Ulster Volunteers marched together and cheered
each other.
However, the Ulster Volunteers were able to enlist in their own Ulster Division,
while National Volunteers were sent to different regiments. There was equally heavy
recruitment from both nationalists and unionists in the early months of the war. But the
different treatment of Ulster Volunteers compared to National Volunteers, along with
the delay in implementing Home Rule, caused nationalist recruitment to slow down.

Plans for a Rising
The IRB (Irish Republican Brotherhood) leaders began to make plans for a rising
soon after the start of World War I. The IRB believed that ‘England’s difficulty was
Ireland’s opportunity.’ They felt that this was a good time for a rising because the English
government’s attention would be distracted from Irish affairs by the World War. The IRB
formed a Military Council to organise the Rising.

Military Council plans
The Military Council needed arms and ammunition and they needed men for the
Rising.
But they also wanted to keep their plans secret, because of the danger that spies
would provide information to the British government.

THE RISE AND IMPACT OF NATIONALISM AND UNIONISM IN IRELAND, 1911–1923

15

In January 1916, the Military Council decided that the Rising would take place at
Easter.

Arms from Germany
Roger Casement got arms from Germany, England’s enemy in the war. The Germans
gave him 20,000 rifles, ten machine guns and ammunition. These were loaded on board
the Aud, which set sail for Ireland.

Involving the Irish Volunteers
Eoin MacNeill and the Irish Volunteers were needed to provide men for the Rising. But
MacNeill was opposed to a rising.
Just before Easter 1916, the Military Council showed MacNeill a document – the
‘Castle Document’ – that said the British government was planning to disarm the Irish
Volunteers. As a result, MacNeill allowed the Irish Volunteers to go ahead with drills and
manoeuvres planned for Easter Sunday.
It now seemed as if all the plans were working out. Arms would be landed in Co.
Kerry, and distributed to Volunteer groups out on training exercises on Easter Sunday.
The Rising would be a national (countrywide) rising.
Then the plans began to go wrong.

The plans go wrong
●●

On the Friday before Easter, the Aud was captured off the Kerry coast. It was sunk by
its captain off Cork harbour and all the arms and ammunition were lost.

●●

Roger Casement was captured in Kerry after coming ashore from a German
submarine.

●●

Eoin MacNeill found out that the Castle Document was a forgery. He then
cancelled the Volunteer manoeuvres for Easter Sunday.

The Military Council decided
that the Rising would go ahead
on Easter Monday, influenced
by Pearse’s ideas of a Blood
Sacrifice, that their deaths
would inspire the rest of the
Irish people and reawaken the
national spirit. However, the
Rising would now be confined
mainly to Dublin. It also had
no hope of military success.
On Easter Monday
morning, 1,500 Volunteers
took over key buildings in
the city centre. The General
Post Office (GPO) became

The British government reaction
The British government was taken by surprise by the Rising. Reinforcements (extra
soldiers) were brought in from the Curragh and from England. A military cordon
(barrier) was thrown around the centre of Dublin. By Wednesday, the rebels were
outnumbered 20 to one. Artillery was brought in, and a gunboat, the Helga, was
brought up the Liffey to shell the GPO.

End of the Rising
By the end of the week, the city centre was in ruins, the rebel positions surrounded,
widespread looting was occurring and many civilians had been killed. On Saturday,
Pearse surrendered unconditionally.
The rebels were rounded up and held as prisoners. Then, between 3 May and 3
August 16 leaders were executed, mostly in Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin.

Why did the Rising fail?
Which of these reasons, do you think, was the most important in explaining the military
failure of the Rising?
Irish Volunteers

British army had
greater fire power

Rising largely

Bad tactics of

What serious mistake did the British government make?
The British government made a serious political mistake in executing the leaders of the
Rising and in rounding up so many people who had nothing to do with the Rising. Irish
public opinion began to favour the Rising. This, along with later events, (see The Rise
of Sinn Féin, p. 242) resulted in those who were involved in the Rising becoming more
popular and eventually leading the main political organisation in Ireland in 1918.

The Independence Struggle, 1919–21
Between 1919 and 1921, nationalists in Ireland organised a strong campaign to gain
independence from Britain. The campaign took two forms:
1. Sinn Féin organised passive resistance, a policy of opposing the British government
without using violence.
2. The Irish Volunteers (who now became known as the Irish Republican Army, or

IRA) organised a guerrilla warfare campaign.

How did passive resistance work?
On 21 January 1919, Sinn Féin held a meeting of the First Dáil Éireann (parliament) in
the Mansion House, Dublin. Only 27 TDs attended, because the remainder were either
in jail or on the run.
On that day, the First Dáil issued:
●● The Declaration of Independence
●●

A Message to the Free Nations of the World

●●

A programme to improve living and working conditions

The actions of the Sinn Féin government showed that they could run an independent
government. The actions also helped to win the battle over public opinion.

The War of Independence, 1919–21
On the same day that the First Dáil met, 21 January 1919, an RIC (Royal Irish
Constabulary) patrol was ambushed in Soloheadbeg, Co. Tipperary. A local IRA unit
led by Dan Breen and Seán Treacy carried out the ambush. The IRA men attacked police
who were guarding a supply of gelignite going to a nearby quarry. Two policemen were
shot dead. These were the first shots of the War of Independence.

Guerrilla warfare
The IRA used guerrilla war tactics against the British government forces. These were
ambush, or ‘hit and run’ tactics. The IRA’s main target was the RIC. They attacked
isolated barracks in the countryside to get arms and ammunition. The IRA also
intimidated the RIC members and their families.

MAKING HISTORY

Flying columns
As the IRA increased in numbers, local units called flying columns were formed. The
men in these units lived off the countryside getting food and shelter from the local
people. Flying columns took part in large-scale ambushes , for example, at Kilmichael
and Crossbarry, Co. Cork.

The role of Michael Collins
Collins operated an intelligence network, using spies to gather information. He got
information from secretaries, porters and policemen. He used this information to direct
operations by the IRA.
He also organised a special group in Dublin called ‘The Squad’. Their job was to kill
spies and detectives.

The British response
The British government, led by David Lloyd George, Prime Minister, recruited ex-soldiers
in Britain to overcome a shortage of recruits in the RIC. Members of the new force became
known as the ‘Black and Tans’, because they wore a mixed army and RIC uniform.
The government also recruited ex-officers. These were known as the Auxiliaries.
Very often these forces carried out reprisals against local people because of attacks on
themselves. These actions helped the IRA, which got greater support from the people.
The British government also introduced the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Under
the Act, two parliaments were to be set up, one in Dublin and one in Belfast. Sinn Féin
rejected this Act.

The Foundation of Northern Ireland
After World War I
There was a different attitude to World War I amongst Northern unionists compared
to nationalists. Northern unionists took pride in their part in the war. Many
commemorated the Battle of the Somme on 1 July each
year when thousands of men from the Ulster Division had
fought and died.
There was also commemoration amongst many

refused to accept this. But unionists in Northern Ireland formed their own
government and parliament after a general election in 1921.
The Northern parliament had power over internal Northern Ireland
affairs, such as education, health, policing and roads. The parliament at
Westminster controlled trade, international relations, peace and war.
This was the way Northern Ireland was ruled for the next 50 years.

Unionist control
The Unionist Party, led by James B. Craig as Prime Minister, dominated
the political system. It won all elections with clear majorities. The party had
close links with the Orange Order, which organised parades and marches
to maintain unionist domination (control).

Select three of the

describe what is
happening in each
of them.

Protestant and Catholic conflict
In the early 1920s, serious conflict arose between Protestants (unionists) and Catholics
(nationalists). Unionists believed that Catholics wanted to destroy Northern Ireland.
●● Unionists were opposed to a united Ireland because they feared being discriminated
against in a nationalist/Catholic-dominated country
●●

They also felt that the Northern Ireland economy would suffer more by being cut off
from the British market

The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) was formed in 1922 as an armed police force. It
had a mostly Protestant membership. It was helped by the B-Specials, a part-time police
force. They could use the Special Powers Act (1922) to arrest and imprison anyone.
Nationalist felt that the B-Specials and the Special Powers Act were used to keep them
down.

Riots
In the sectarian riots in the early 1920s between Protestants and Catholics, Catholics
suffered more than Protestants:
●● More Catholics were killed
●●

Thousands of Catholics lost their jobs – in the most famous incident, Catholics
were driven out of the Harland and Wolff shipyards (July 1920)

●●

Catholic houses and businesses were burned

The IRA continued a campaign in the north during 1922. RUC were attacked and killed,
big houses were burned, and railway stations were attacked. There were continued
killings of Catholics and Protestants in Belfast.
The outbreak of the Civil War in the south ended the violence. Over a period of two
years from 1920 to 1922, 557 people had been killed in Northern Ireland – almost 60
per cent of these were Catholics.

The British government was being criticised at home and in America for the actions
of the Black and Tans and the Auxiliaries

●●

The war was costing the government a great deal of money

De Valera returned from America where he had been during most of the War of
Independence. He agreed the terms of a ceasefire with Lloyd George. The ceasefire came
into operation on 11 July 1921.

The Anglo-Irish Treaty, 1921
Delegations
After the truce, the British government and Sinn Féin began negotiations. The Sinn
Féin government selected a delegation to represent them at the talks in London. The
delegates were Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins, Robert Barton, Eamonn Duggan and
George Gavan Duffy.
De Valera refused to go because:
●● He was head of state
●●

He wanted to control extremists at home

Lloyd George headed the British delegation. He was assisted by Winston Churchill,
Austin Chamberlain and Lord Birkenhead.

Different aims
Sinn Féin had two main goals in the negotiations:
●● To achieve a republic (complete independence from Britain)
●●

To have no border, or partition, between the north and south of Ireland

The main British aim was:
●● To keep Ireland within the British Empire (or Commonwealth, as it was known).

Negotiations
From October to December 1921, the two delegations negotiated in London. Finally,
on 6 December 1921, they signed the ‘Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland’, or the
Anglo-Irish Treaty.

The terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty
1. Ireland would be known as the Irish Free State.
2. Ireland would still be a dominion (part of) the British Commonwealth.
3. The King of England would be represented in Ireland by a Governor-general.
4. Members of the Dáil and Seanad (Senate) would take an oath of allegiance to the

5. Britain would have the use of three ports (the ‘Treaty ports’) – Berehaven, Cobh

and Lough Swilly.
6. A Boundary Commission would be established to decide on the border between

the north and south of Ireland.

The Treaty debates
There was widespread debate in Ireland over the terms of the Treaty. The Dáil debated
the Treaty from December 1921 to January 1922.

The debate sometimes became very emotional. It concluded on 7 January 1922, when
the Treaty was accepted by 64 votes to 57. De Valera resigned as President of the
Executive Council. He and his supporters left the Dáil. The Pro-Treaty side now took
over the government, with Arthur Griffith replacing de Valera as president.

The Irish Civil War

22Explore how

After the Dáil debates, the divisions between the Pro-Treaty and Anti-Treaty sides grew
wider. Very often, families and friends disagreed.
The slide towards Civil War began when a group of Republicans (Anti-Treaty)
took over the Four Courts in the centre of Dublin in April 1922. This was a direct
challenge to the government. The government was also under pressure from the British
government who feared that war would break out again.
A general election in June 1922 gave a huge majority in favour of the Treaty. This
put the Free State government in a stronger position. When the Republicans in the Four
Courts captured a Free State general, Griffith and Collins decided to attack them.

The Munster Republic
The Republicans retreated south of a line from
Limerick to Waterford. This area became known
as the ‘Munster Republic’. However, the Free
State army, which now had 60,000 soldiers, easily
captured Limerick and Waterford. Collins decided
to use ships to carry troops to Cork, and to Fenit in
Kerry. The Republicans were now forced to retreat to
the countryside.

Guerrilla warfare and the end of the Civil War
The Republicans now resorted to guerrilla warfare. But they were not as successful as
they had been during the War of Independence.
●● Most of the people now supported the Treaty.
●●

The Free State army knew the countryside as well as the Republicans did.

The Civil War became very bitter. Both sides carried out brutal killings. The war
dragged on until Liam Lynch, leader of the Anti-Treaty IRA, was killed in April 1923.
Frank Aiken replaced him as chief of staff. Aiken and de Valera decided to call a
ceasefire in May 1923.
