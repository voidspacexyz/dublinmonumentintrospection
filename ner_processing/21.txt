22Consider why

Ireland in 1939
When World War II broke out in September, 1939, the South of Ireland (also called
Éire) was part of the British Commonwealth. However, in the years since independence
was achieved, the South of Ireland had won greater freedom from Britain.
Éamon de Valera was Taoiseach, and a new Constitution for the country had been
established in 1937. This made the country a republic in all but name.

the South
of Ireland
was
neutral during
World War II
22Describe how World
War II impacted on
the lives of people in
the South

Neutral or not
When war broke out in September,
1939, the South of Ireland declared
itself neutral. This meant that the
South of Ireland would not fight
in the war and would not support
either side. This showed how
independent the country was now.
The South of Ireland also favoured
neutrality because:
●● Northern Ireland was still part
of the United Kingdom
●●

Ireland was too weak to fight
stronger countries

Speaking in the Dáil in September, 1939, de Valera said, ‘The government stands before you
as the guardians of the interest of our people, and it is to guard those interests as best we can
that we are proposing to follow the policy of neutrality.’

1. In the main story, what
measures (laws) did the
Oireachtas (parliament,
Dáil and Seanad) pass?
2. How long did the Dáil
and Seanad sit to get the
measures through?
3. Did any person vote
against declaring ‘a state
of national emergency’?
4. Is this a primary or a
secondary source?
5. Would you consider the
reporting to be biased or
objective?

MAKING HISTORY

Neutrality in action
The government passed the Emergency Powers Act, which gave it great power to control
the country. The ‘Emergency’ was the word used to describe the situation in the South
of Ireland during World War II.
The government also built up the defence forces, in case the South of Ireland was
invaded during the war. These were increased from about 20,000 to almost 250,000
part-time and full-time soldiers. The Irish government also censored radio and
newspaper reports, to maintain a neutral position.
Even though Ireland was neutral, the Irish
government favoured the Allies (Britain,
France and the United States). This policy
meant that Allied planes were allowed to fly
out over Donegal from Northern Ireland, to
patrol the Atlantic.

Shortages and rationing

A ration book

The South of Ireland was short of raw materials
during the war. Seán Lemass, as Minister for
Supplies, had to buy and charter ships to bring
supplies to the country. Rationing of food,
clothes, footwear and petrol had to be introduced because of the shortages. Coupons
from ration books were exchanged for goods in the shops.
Ireland had surplus food, but some foods had to be imported. A series of compulsory
tillage orders were enacted to increase the growing of crops such as wheat. However,
there were still shortages, which could not be made up by imports.
People overcame the shortages by other means.
Tea leaves were used over and over again. Bread was
baked using Irish wheat, and some people called it
‘black bread’. Goods could always be bought on the
‘black market’, but they were very expensive.

Gas inspectors (or
glimmer men)
checked out the
use of gas in
houses. What does
this cartoon say
about the attitude
of people to the
glimmer men?

Fuel shortages
Electricity and gas were also rationed.
Inspectors called ‘glimmer men’ called to
houses to ensure that people were not using
the little gas that was left in the pipes. Very
little coal was imported from England, so
turf replaced coal as a fuel. The trains had to
use turf instead of coal. Because of this, the
train journey from Cork to Dublin often took
fourteen hours. Many people went off to the

South of Ireland, and 64,000 volunteers from Northern Ireland. About
7,500 of those died in the war. There were nine Irish winners of the
Victoria Cross, including one from Northern Ireland.
The war had little direct impact on the lives of the people of the
South. It was bombed on a number of occasions by German planes. The
most serious bombing was in the North Strand in Dublin in May 1941,
when 34 people were killed.

Q

Curragh camp
During the war, some British, American and German planes lost their
way and crash-landed in the South. Some of the pilots died in the
crashes, some survived.
The government decided that since the country was neutral,
servicemen from countries involved in the war who ended up in the
South would be interned for the war. These were held in the Curragh
camp in separate detention centres, in corrugated iron huts.
The atmosphere in the camps was very relaxed and German prisoners
could go on trips in the locality or to Dublin. Some studied in Trinity
College, and married Irish women. In 1943, the Allied airmen were
moved elsewhere, and were secretly freed. After the war, the German
internees were sent back to Germany.
The IRA members were also held in a separate camp in the Curragh.
The IRA wanted to use the war to invade Northern Ireland. They raided
the government magazine in the Phoenix Park in 1939 and took 1
million rounds of ammunition, which was later recovered. De Valera
arrested and imprisoned IRA leaders in the Curragh; some were executed,
and some died on hunger strike.

The Merchant Navy: Irish ships kept
the supply lines open by importing
badly needed goods. The ships had
ÉIRE printed in very large letters and
marked the colours of the Irish flag
on the sides of the ships. However,
this did not always save them from
being targeted. Sixteen Irish merchant
ships were sunk during World War II.
This led to the loss of 149 men killed
and 32 men wounded. These men are
commemorated in a monument at City
Quay, Dublin.

HISTORICAL JUDGEMENT

Ballincollig, near Cork city, had a population of 252 in the 1930s. The village
experienced the impact of the war, either through its barracks, which was re-opened,
or through the lives of its people.
The experiences of Ballincollig reflect the lives of most people in other parts of
the South of Ireland during World War II.

Fuel
Because of shipping difficulties, [Ireland] could not get in fuel
supplies. Petrol was rationed very early on, and people got coupons
for each month. Mr Tanner told us they had to use the horse and trailer
when the month’s allowance was gone [for delivering milk to Cork
city].
But most people did not have cars anyway, so it made little difference
to them. Everyone had a bicycle, and often cycled long journeys.
Coal was also scarce, so a big effort went into turf cutting. Miss Judge
remembered they bought part of a bog, and brought home turf in
a horse and cart. The Army was sent out to harvest turf, but some
soldiers did not like the work.

People told us that they could still go out and enjoy

dances, and to the hurling and football matches.

THE IMPACT OF WORLD WAR II ON IRELAND, NORTH AND SOUTH

Life in Northern Ireland during
World War II
Crucial role of the North
In Northern Ireland, the story was different to the South. Northern Ireland, as part
of the United Kingdom, took an active part in the war. Even though conscription
(compulsory enlistment in the army) was not enforced in Northern Ireland because of
nationalist objections there, rationing was. Moreover, the German occupation of France
and the neutrality of Southern Ireland meant that Northern Ireland played a crucial role
in World War II.
Planes based in Northern Ireland were used to patrol the North Atlantic and look
for German U-boats and to protect convoys bringing supplies to Britain and Northern
Ireland.
When the United States joined the war in December 1941, Northern Ireland became
an important base for American troops. At one time, 120,000 American sailors and
airmen were based in the country. Some were manning ships to protect the Atlantic
trade, while others were preparing for D-Day.

MAKING HISTORY

The North’s industries
Northern Ireland’s industries grew, so unemployment fell from pre-war levels of 25% to
5% during the war. Warships and merchant ships were built at Harland and Wolff, over
1,600 aircraft were built by Shorts. Tanks, parachutes, rope and shells were all produced
for the war effort.
The North’s farmers also prospered. They received guaranteed prices for their food
on the British market. Food was shipped from Belfast port to Britain every day, as
compulsory tillage orders increased the acreage under flax, oats and potatoes.

Northern Ireland’s contribution to World War II
Historian Thomas Hennessy said, ‘Northern Ireland’s main contribution came in the areas
of food production and munitions. Farmers provided Britain with £3 million worth of cattle and
sheep per year, 20% of home-produced eggs and 25,000 gallons of liquid milk in four out of six
wartime winters. Belfast’s shipyards produced 140 warships, 123 merchant ships and repaired
3,000 ships. Munitions producers manufactured 75 million shells, 180 million incendiary
bullets, 50,000 bayonets, and a variety of other military material. ... Northern Ireland’s only
Victoria Cross was won by James Magennis, a Belfast Catholic in the Royal Navy, in July 1945.’

Belfast attacked – the Belfast Blitz
Belfast was poorly defended during the war, with only 22 anti-aircraft
batteries, no searchlights and no night fighters to guard it. It was an easy
target for German bombers. The Northern government thought Belfast was
too far away from Germany.
The city and its industries were heavily attacked four times in April and
May, 1941, during the Belfast Blitz. In all, over 1,100 people were killed in
these attacks.
Half the houses of the city were destroyed, leaving thousands homeless
and also showing the great poverty in the working-class areas of Belfast. On
two occasions the Southern government sent fire brigades to Belfast to help
the people there.
As a result of the raids, thousands of people left the city, some to the
South of Ireland, most to towns outside of Belfast. Also thousands left each
night to shelter in the surrounding countryside until morning.

James Magennis, VC

What do you think of
the advice given in this
poster ‘IF THE INVADER
COMES’?

VE-Day
Victory in Europe Day was celebrated in the streets of Belfast and elsewhere in
Northern Ireland.
In Dublin, Trinity College students celebrated the victory of the Allies in Europe.
However, they provoked a counter-demonstration by UCD students who took
exception to the way the Trinity College students flew flags from the roof of the
university building – they had placed the Irish flag lowest of the flags hoisted on the
mast.
