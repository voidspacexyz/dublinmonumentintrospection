Ireland in 1840

12

Preparing to emigrate

In 1840, Ireland was ruled directly from London. The British government ruled through
a Lord Lieutenant in the Vice-regal Lodge in the Phoenix Park, and a Chief Secretary in
Dublin Castle.
Ireland’s population grew rapidly in the 18th and early 19th centuries. In 1841,
there were 8.2 million people living in the country. Most of the people lived in the
countryside. Only three cities had populations of more than 50,000 – Dublin, Cork and
Belfast. Of these, only Belfast was industrialised, like cities in England.

22Examine the

causes of the
Great Famine

The land
Landlords owned most of the land. They were descended
from the planters who received land in the plantations
of the 16th and 17th centuries. They rented the land to
tenant farmers. In turn, these farmers worked their land,
and some employed labourers to help them.
The landlord’s agent collected rent twice a year.
Tenants could be evicted for any reason, but they were
usually only evicted for non-payment of rent.
Some labourers were cottiers. Cottiers rented a small
plot of ground – called conacre – from a farmer. In
return they worked on the farm to pay off the rent. Other
labourers were landless. These were the poorest people,
living in mud cabins on the edge of towns, or renting
rooms in lodging houses.

Evans of Eton, Killary, near the Mouth of the Bundoracha

Poverty in the country
There was much poverty in the country in the 1840s. The growing
population, failed harvests and dependence on farming were all causes
of poverty. Many people emigrated as a result of the poverty. In all, 1.5
million people emigrated from Ireland to the United States, Canada and
more so to England, in the thirty years before the Great Famine.
For poor people who lived in Ireland, there was the workhouse. The
British government passed a Poor Law Act in 1838. This set up Poor
Law Unions (or districts), each with a workhouse. People who needed
help had to move to the workhouse.

The causes of the Great Famine
Ireland experienced the Great Famine between 1845 and 1850. The principal causes of
the famine were:

Millions

The population of Ireland grew from 6.8 million in 1821 to 8.2 million in
1841, in spite of emigration. Some areas of the country, such as counties in
Connacht, were more densely populated than others. As the population
increased, people became poorer. The poorest were the labourers, cottiers
and small farmers with less than five acres. (See pie chart p. 188)

Subdivision of the land

Most of the people depended on farming because the manufacturing
industry was not developed like in Britain. As the population grew, fathers
subdivided their land between their sons, and gave a dowry to their daughters.
Other farmers sublet their land as conacre to pay for labourers. As the farms got
smaller, families became poorer.

Dependence on the potato
Poorer families depended on the potato to live. Their three meals a day consisted of
potatoes only. By the 1840s, the potato was almost the only food for about 4 million
families.

Blight is a disease that attacks and rots potatoes.
When the blight destroyed the potato crop, those
who depended on the potato had no other food
and so they starved.

MAKING HISTORY

The progress of the famine
The blight was reported in America in 1843. By the autumn of 1845, it was in Ireland.
Only some areas were affected, and the early crop had escaped. For this reason, very few
people died.
The blight hit again in 1846. This time the entire crop was destroyed so starvation
and hardship affected many people. The blight was less severe in 1847. However, the
seed potatoes used for planting had been eaten so the crop was smaller. Starvation was
widespread.
In 1848, the blight struck again with greater force. People had planted extra potatoes,
but the potatoes rotted. Many people who had survived the earlier years died or
emigrated. The blight struck again in 1849 and 1850, but the worst effects of the famine
were over.

What did the British Government do?
The government of Sir Robert Peel acted quickly in 1845 when reports of the blight
came in. Peel ordered the importation of £100,000 (the equivalent of €10.2 million in
2018) worth of Indian corn (or maize), enough to feed 1 million people. This was sold
through government depots. It helped to reduce the impact of the famine in 1845. Peel
also set up public works schemes so that poor people could earn money by working on
roads and piers.
British government policy towards the Great Famine changed when Lord John
Russell replaced Peel as Prime Minister in 1846. The new government believed in a
policy of laissez-faire.
They believed that the government should not interfere in the workings of the
economy. Government interference, they said, would only make matters worse because
it would encourage landlords and tenants to do little to improve the situation. They also
believed that ‘Irish property (the landlords) should pay for Irish poverty’.

Russell’s government expanded the public works schemes for roads and piers. By
1847, 750,000 people were employed in these schemes. The government also passed the
Soup Kitchen Act (1847), after seeing the success of the Quakers’ soup kitchens. Soup
was cooked in large boilers and given to the people. Three million people were fed each
day. But the government closed down the soup kitchens after six months, in September
1847. They said all relief (help) would be provided through the workhouses.

workhouses, built for about 100,000 people. Although new
workhouses were opened, overcrowding continued, conditions
were bad and disease spread quickly. The government also
provided ‘outdoor relief’ for another 800,000 people.
Overall, the British government’s response was influenced by the view that local
authorities should only look for government help when they really needed it. Many
government ministers also blamed Irish landlords and they felt the landlords should
pay for sorting out the problems. But the government could have continued to import
Indian corn and keep the soup kitchens open.

Disease
The weakened people suffered from many diseases. Indeed, more died from disease
than from starvation. Typhus and relapsing fever, or ‘yellow fever’, were the most
serious sicknesses. Where starvation affected the poor, these diseases affected everybody,
rich and poor alike.

Emigration
Thousands emigrated each year during
the famine to Britain, the United States
and Canada. About 215,000 people left
for America in 1847, and over 200,000
emigrated each year for the next five years.
Landlords who wanted to clear their estates
helped some. Others, sent one family
member over to work in order to pay for the
passage of the rest of the family later.
The ships were often unsuitable for
the difficult voyage to North America.
Conditions were so bad on some ships that
they were called ‘coffin ships’.

The Jeanie Johnston made her maiden voyage on 24 April 1848 from
Blennerville, Co. Kerry to Quebec with 193 passengers. Over the next seven
years, the ship made 16 voyages to North America carrying over 2,500
emigrants without loss of life to the New World. A replica of the original
Jeanie Johnston is docked in Custom House Quay, Dublin.

supply of water shipped on board was abundant,
but the quantity served out to the passengers was so
scanty that they were frequently obliged to throw
overboard their salt provisions and rice, because
they had not water enough both for the necessary
cooking and the satisfying of their raging thirst
afterwards. No cleanliness was enforced; the beds

though at irregular times; but false measures were

consequences
of the Great
Famine

The population of Ireland fell by at least two million between 1845 and 1851. In all,
one million died from hunger and disease, while one million emigrated.
The cottiers and agricultural labourers were worst hit. The counties along the
western seaboard suffered the greatest fall in population. The population continued to
decline after the famine due to emigration and a low birth rate.
Emigration continued to America, Canada and Britain, and this along with earlier
emigration created the Irish Diaspora – the scattering of the Irish population around
the world.

Subdivision ended
The practice of subdividing the land ended. Instead, the eldest son got the land, and
other sons and daughters were forced to emigrate. The eldest son only got the farm
when his father died, so he married late. This reduced the birth rate in Ireland.
There was also clearance of estates during the famine and this, combined with the
ending of subdivision, resulted in larger farms.

Decline in the Irish language
The Irish-speaking areas in the West and South-West of Ireland were the worst hit by
death and emigration. This contributed to the decline of the Irish language.

Irish speakers in 1851?

Politics
The English government was blamed for the famine. Emigrants took their hatred of
England with them to America. They later supported the Fenians, the Land League,
Home Rule, the rebels in the 1916 Rising and the IRA when these groups opposed the
British government.

Significance of the Irish Diaspora

22Evaluate the

The Irish Diaspora ‘comprises emigrants from Ireland and their descendants around the
world’.
During and after the Great Famine, the bulk of Irish emigration went to America.
Irish emigrants there poured into east coast cities such as New York and Boston. They
lived in crowded tenements, cellars and attics. They experienced diseases such as typhus
and cholera from bad living conditions. They worked in poorly paid jobs; women
worked as domestic servants and men worked in hard-labouring
jobs such as canal and railroad construction. They also suffered from
discrimination and anti-Irish hatred.
However, within a generation the Irish had climbed the social
ladder. The next generation availed of jobs such as policemen,
firefighters and teachers. They were better educated and more
successful. They laid the foundation for the future success of the
Irish in America. The links between the Irish-Americans and Ireland
remain strong in modern times, through politics, tourism and
culture.

nothing with him except two

and a strong desire for liberty.
I am glad to say that all of

(President Kennedy,

in Wexford in 1963)

Irish-Americans increased their influence in American politics through the Democratic Party, one of America’s two
main political parties. President Kennedy was the first Catholic Irish-American president. Name some of the other
Irish-American presidents before and after Kennedy. What province in Ireland can claim the most of these? Why?

Irish-born and people of Irish
descent have contributed
to many aspects of life in
other countries, particularly
America, Australia and Britain.
The early emigrants often
suffered discrimination in
these countries – ‘No Irish Need
Apply’ – but later generations
contributed to politics, music
and entertainment, art and
literature, the sciences and
engineering, and sport.
