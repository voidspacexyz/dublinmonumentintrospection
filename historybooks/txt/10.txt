Political Traditions in
Modern Ireland
There were two main political traditions in Ireland –
nationalism and unionism.
●● Nationalism sought to gain independence from
Britain while unionism wanted to maintain
British rule in Ireland.
Nationalists disagreed about how they would achieve
independence.

EXPLORING THE 1798 REBELLION – The Impact of the Physical Force Tradition on Irish Politics

●●

●●

Some believed in parliamentary means – that
is, using the British Parliament to pass laws to
give independence to Ireland. This tradition
used peaceful means to achieve its aim of an
independent Ireland. Leaders associated with
this tradition in the 18th and 19th centuries
included Henry Grattan, Daniel O’Connell, Isaac
Butt, Charles Stewart Parnell and John Redmond.
Others supported physical force as a means
of achieving independence. This would mean
organising armed rebellion or uprising to
defeat the British army in Ireland. Leaders
associated with this tradition in the 18th and 19th
centuries included Wolfe Tone, Robert Emmet,
William O’Brien, James Stephens and Jeremiah
O’Donovan Rossa.

These political traditions were dominant at different
times during those centuries. The traditions also
continued into the 20th century, and we will look at
this later.

HISTORICAL CONCEPTS

Ireland in 1790
The Protestant Ascendancy
At the end of the 18th century, Ireland was ruled by a parliament in Dublin that was
under the control of Great Britain. The Irish Parliament was controlled by the Protestant
Ascendancy, that is, by members of the Church of Ireland (or Anglican Church). Even
though they made up only 15 per cent of the population, they owned most of the land
of Ireland, which they got during the plantations.
The power of
the Protestant
Ascendancy

Catholic and Presbyterian discontent

The Protestant Ascendancy used the penal laws
to maintain its power in Ireland. These were
laws that discriminated against Catholics and

countryside
been abolished (repealed), Catholics and
Presbyterians still protested about the remaining laws. They also had to pay tithes (onetenth of their crops) to support the Anglican clergy.

Poverty in the countryside
The majority of people in Ireland lived in the countryside. Most of the people were
tenant farmers and landless labourers. The population of Ireland doubled in the 18th
century, so many farms were subdivided. As a result, many people were very badly off.

The influence of the American Revolution
The Americans had won their independence from Britain in 1783. This was an example
for some in Ireland, led by Henry Grattan, who wanted the Irish Parliament to have
more power. In the circumstances, the Irish Volunteers won the right for the Irish
Parliament to make its own laws (legislative independence) in 1782.

Q The influence of the French Revolution

What caused
discontent in Ireland
in 1790?

The principles of the French Revolution – liberty, equality and fraternity (brotherhood,
nationality) – were popular in Ireland, especially among Presbyterians in Belfast. Some
political leaders wanted the French revolutionary principles put into practice in Ireland.

The United Irishmen
The Society of the United Irishmen was founded in Belfast on 18 October 1791. They
wanted to reduce English power in Ireland.
●● To do that they sought the ‘complete and radical reform of the representation of the people
in Parliament.’
●●

They wanted to include ‘Irishmen of every religious persuasion’, including Catholics, in
that reform.

on. I do further declare that I will

revolutionary movement?
2. What, do you think, is the wider revolutionary movement?
3. What are the aims of the United Irishmen according to the Oath?
4. How does the oath show that the United Irishmen began as a
peaceful organisation?

Wolfe Tone

Theobald Wolfe Tone, a Dublin lawyer, was present at the founding meeting of the
United Irishmen. He came to prominence when he wrote a pamphlet, An Argument on
behalf of the Catholics of Ireland (1791).
Tone supported the British government getting rid of some more of the penal laws
but he was disappointed that the government did not get rid of them all.

The influence of war
War broke out between Britain and France in 1793 and this changed everything. Now
the British feared a French invasion so they stopped any further reforms and brought in
a policy of repression.
The United Irishmen were banned so they became a secret, oath-bound society.
Instead of seeking parliamentary reform, they started
planning an anti-English rebellion and a republic.

22Explain
the role of
Wolfe Tone

Q

What were the
aims of the United
Irishmen? Why did
their aims change?
What part did Tone
play?

Wolfe Tone sought help
Tone went to America first, and then to France.
He asked the French revolutionary government for
help. They provided a fleet of 43 ships and 15,000
soldiers, with one of their most able commanders,
General Hoche. They failed to land in Bantry Bay in
1796 due to bad weather. Tone, on board one of the
ships, was very disappointed.
‘We have now been six days in Bantry Bay within
500 yards of the shore without being able to land. ....
all our hopes are now reduced to getting back safely to
Brest (France), and I believe we will set sail for that
port the instant the weather will permit.’

EXPLORING THE 1798 REBELLION – The Impact of the Physical Force Tradition on Irish Politics

Closer to the Rebellion
The British government took action to stop the rebellion. The British commander,
General Lake, used his troops to burn houses, flog and torture suspects and confiscate
arms in Ulster and Leinster.
There was also conflict between Catholics and Protestants in Ulster. Peep-o’-Day
Boys (Protestant group) clashed with the Defenders (Catholic group). After one such
clash in 1795, the Orange Order was founded to maintain Protestant control.
By now though, the United Irishmen had grown to 300,000 members, and
the leaders drew up plans for a rising (rebellion). However, the government used
information from spies to arrest the leaders, including Lord Edward Fitzgerald (1798).
He was wounded during his arrest and died a couple of weeks later.

Croppies Lie Down!
This was an anti-rebel song from 1798. It refers to
those with close cropped hair, in imitation of the
French revolutionaries.
We soldiers of Erin, so proud of the name,
We’ll raise on the rebels and Frenchmen our fame;
We’ll fight to the last in the honest old cause,
And guard our religion, our freedom and laws;
We’ll fight for our country, our King and his crown,
And make all the traitors and croppies lie down.
Down, down, croppies lie down.
The rebels so bold, when they’ve none to oppose,
To houses and haystacks are terrible foes;
They murder poor parsons and likewise their wives,
At the sight of a soldier they run for their lives;
Whenever we march over country and town
In ditches and cellars the croppies lie down.
Down, down, croppies lie down.

Q

Where did the main
events of the 1798
Rebellion or Rising
occur?

Even though the leaders were arrested, the rebellion broke out in four main areas.
(i) In the counties of Dublin, Kildare and Meath, a rising was signalled by attacks on
the mail coaches. But the rising was easily put down.
(ii) The most serious rising took place in County Wexford. The actions of the
yeomanry (a part-time force) and the militia (a full-time force) provoked a rising
led by Father John Murphy and Bagenal Harvey, a Protestant landowner. They had
victories at Oulart Hill, Enniscorthy and Wexford town. The rebel forces burned
over 100 Protestants in a barn in Scullabogue and killed nearly 100 in Wexford
town. They were defeated at New Ross and Arklow, and later at a major battle at
Vinegar Hill, near Enniscorthy. After that, the leaders were executed.
(iii) A further rising took place in Ulster, in Counties Antrim and Down. The leaders,
Henry Joy McCracken in Co. Antrim and Henry Munro in Co. Down were each
defeated and executed.
(iv) French troops, led by General Humbert, landed in Killala, Co. Mayo. He defeated
the British at the Races of Castlebar but was later defeated in Ballinamuck, Co.
Longford.

Tone got further help from the French

board the French fleet off the coast of Donegal.
He was taken to Dublin, tried for treason and
found guilty. He was sentenced to death. His
request to be shot like a soldier was refused,
so he committed suicide.

What conclusions can we dra

first acknowledge that the
rounding up of suspected gov

(supporters) was common
practice everywhere in We
xford during the rebellion,
and the killing of prisoners
was not unknown either; in
this sense what
happened at Scullabogue wa
s part of a larger pattern, alth
ough on a larger
scale and carried out in an
especially brutal manner. Bey
ond this though, the
evidence strongly suggests
that the killings took place
as an immediate reaction
to atrocities in the battle of
New Ross, raging six miles
away. … Finally, while it
cannot be denied that sectar
ian hatred (hatred between
religions, groups) had
some part to play in the affa
ir, I suspect that as we learn
more about the crime
and the people who carried
it out, … the sectarian dimens
ion (aspect) will then
come to appear far more inc

the affair than it has
seemed up to this.

Irish history

HISTORICAL
SIGNIFICANCE

The Act of Union
The Act of Union (1800) was passed which ended the parliament in Dublin. Instead,
all Irish members of parliament (M.P’s) and Irish Lords sat in the parliament in
Westminster. Ireland was now ruled directly from London.

❰❰p. 96

Memory
For decades, families who had supported the Rebellion sought safety in suppressing
their memories; Anna Kinsella (a historian) points out that the earliest known 1798
memorial in Co. Wexford was erected as late as 1875 in Bunclody. (The Irish Times, 10
January 1998)

Catholics and Protestants in conflict
‘The bloodshed and murder confirmed two awful lessons. For Catholics, that the state
(government) and its allies, (especially perhaps its Orange allies) would, if provoked, impose a
bloody terror on the countryside. For Protestants, on the other hand, it became easy to claim that
Catholics could not be trusted: given a chance they would use their power, as at Scullabogue, to
destroy the other community. Both sides now believed the worst of each other.’ (Paul Bew, The
Politics of Enmity 1789–2006, [2007])

Republic and physical
force
The United Irishmen movement
influenced later generations.
The United Irishmen put forward
the concept (idea) of a republic
as the right form of Irish
independence. They also had
fought and died for the republic.
For some people in later years,
armed rising (physical force)
was the only way a republic
would be gained.

Boolavogue
At Boolavogue as the sun was setting
O’ér the bright May meadows of Shelmalier
A rebel hand set the heather blazing
And brought the neighbours from far and near
Then Father Murphy from old Kilcormack
Spurred up the rock with a warning cry
‘Arm, arm’ he cried, ‘for I’ve come to lead you
For Ireland’s freedom we fight or die’

Boolavogue was composed in 1898, on the cente
nary

of
the 1798 Rebellion

Listen to the song
being sung on
YouTube.

1. What is the message of this verse of ‘Bool
avogue’?
2. Is the song propaganda?
3. What do you think about the song, after
listening
to it?

‘I have but one request to ask at my departure

is the charity of its silence. Let no man write my
epitaph; for as no

now to vindicate

William Smith
O’Brien, one
of the main
organisers
of the 1848
Rising

The main event of the Rising of 1848 was an attack on a
group of Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) besieged in the
Widow McCormack’s house in Ballingarry, Co. Tipperary
One result of the 1848 Rising was the
tricolour flag of green, white and orange,
which later became the national flag of
Ireland. ‘The white in the centre signifies a
lasting truce between the “orange” and the
“green”.’ (Thomas Francis Meagher)

The Fenian Rising of 1867
The Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) organised the Fenian
Rising of 1867. The efforts at a rising in Ireland failed, but the IRB
continued to exist. Members of the IRB organised the 1916 Rising.
