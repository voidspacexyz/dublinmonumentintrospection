22Explain why

the 1960s was
an important
decade in
Ireland

22Debate the

importance
of economic
changes in
Ireland in the
1960s

The 1960s in Ireland were characterised by certain important issues:
●● The Republic of Ireland had experienced serious unemployment and emigration
during the 1950s, which contrasted with the prosperity of Europe and Britain. New
economic policies were brought in to solve these problems.
●●

Ireland began to open a window to the wider world as prosperity increased during
the 1960s. The economic changes led to important changes in society.

●●

Northern Ireland was ruled the same way it had been since 1920, with a unionist
majority. Better education for Catholics and the example of the civil rights
campaigns in America led to a civil rights campaign in Northern Ireland.

What Important Changes Occurred in
Economic Policy in the 1960s?
Introduction – the 1950s
There was high unemployment
and high emigration in Ireland
in the 1950s and the population
fell. Government policy was based
on protecting home industry
by putting taxes on imports
(protectionism). Emigration
averaged 40,000 a year in that
decade, workers’ income fell and
there were fewer people working.
Changes were needed in the way
the country was run.

2. What are the strengths and weaknesses
of secondary sources?
3. What would the returning immigrant

4. What was ‘as common as ever’?
5. Give one fact and one opinion from
this extract. Explain your answers by
referring to evidence in the source.

THE 1960S – An Important Decade in Irish History

25

The Republic of Ireland
Seán Lemass became Taoiseach in 1959, and he promoted a new economic policy. This
was called the First Programme for Economic Expansion.
He abolished the old policy of protection because it had failed and instead:
●● Encouraged exports
Gave tax concessions and grants to attract foreign industry to set up factories in
Ireland.

This brought British and American
companies to Ireland. Employment rose
and emigration slowed down. Living
standards also rose, as people were better
off. The population began to increase
from 1961 onwards.
There were other programmes
for economic expansion during the
1960s, but these were not as successful.
However, the economic changes that
occurred in 1960s Ireland were the basis
for future progress in the country.

improved. New schools were built and
older ones were refurbished. The Minister for Education, Donogh O’Malley, brought
in a scheme for free secondary education and free transport, which was introduced in
1967. The first community and comprehensive schools were also built. These combined
the academic subjects of the secondary school with the practical subjects of the
vocational school. Numbers going to secondary school increased rapidly.
At the time, about a third – or 17,000 children – who finished primary school were
dropping out of education; at 15 years of age fewer than 50 per cent were still in fulltime education. By 16, only 36 per cent were still at school.
Within a decade of the policy change, participation rates in second-level had doubled.
Today, Ireland has one of the highest rates of second-level completion in the EU,
with more than 90 per cent of the population completing the Leaving Cert.

What Important Social Changes
Occurred?

The 1960s were the ‘Swinging Sixties’ in contrast to the depressed fifties.
People were better off in Ireland in the 1960s. There were many changes in the way
people lived. The first shopping centres were built. These encouraged weekly rather than
daily shopping, and they undermined the local grocery shop. More tourists came to the
country, and more Irish people holidayed abroad, and these changes opened up the
country to the wider world.
The Catholic Church brought in many reforms after Vatican II, the major church
council (see p. 381). The Latin Mass was changed to the vernacular (English or Irish),
the priest faced the people, there was greater
lay participation in church services, folk
masses were introduced and there were better
relations with other religions (ecumenism).

Teilifís Éireann (later RTÉ) was set up and television brought in new ideas to the
country (1961). In programmes like The Late Late Show and 7 Days many topics in Irish
society were opened up for discussion and investigation. ‘The critical achievement of Irish
television in the 1960s [was that it] forced us to look at ourselves new.’ (Tobin)
When John F. Kennedy, President of the United States, came to Ireland in 1963, he
said:
‘You have modernised your economy, harnessed your rivers, diversified your industry,
liberalised your trade, electrified your farms, accelerated your rate of growth and improved the
living standards of your people.’

THE 1960S – An Important Decade in Irish History

25

What Important Changes Occurred in
Entertainment in the 1960s in Ireland?
Cinema and television
Cinema continued to be popular up to the 1960s, when television led to its decline.
This was one of the consequences of the setting up of RTÉ. Sports programmes and soap
operas attracted audiences, as did programmes such as The Late Late Show, on which
controversial topics were discussed. It was easier and cheaper to stay at home watching
television rather than going to the cinema.

Traditional music
There was a boom in Irish traditional music in the 1960s, which became
popular with a new generation. Seán Ó Riada and his Ceoltóirí Cualainn
modernised the sound of Irish traditional music. Ó Riada wrote the score
for Mise Éire (1959), a documentary on the 1916 Rising and its aftermath,
which was played by an orchestra. As part of the revival of Irish music, there
was also a ballad boom. Here groups such as The Dubliners and the Clancy
Brothers and Tommy Makem brought Irish folk songs to a wider audience.
The continuing popularity of Irish traditional music owes much to changes
made in the 1960s.

Northern
Ireland in the

What Changes made the 1960s Important
in Northern Ireland?

A new Prime Minister, Terence O’Neill, took over in Northern Ireland in 1963. The
North’s traditional industries – shipbuilding, aircraft manufacture and linen – were
in serious decline. He said his main goals were ‘to make Northern Ireland economically
stronger and prosperous … and to build bridges between the two traditions in our community.’
In industry, the O’Neill government attracted new industries to the North – Ford,
Goodyear and Imperial Chemicals. These industries were mostly located in the
Protestant, eastern part of Ulster.
O’Neill also tried to improve relations with Catholics. He took over from a Prime
Minister before him, Lord Brookeborough, who ‘never crossed the border (with the South),
never visited a Catholic school, and never received or sought a civic reception from a Catholic
town.’
●● In contrast, O’Neill met the Catholic Cardinal Conway, Archbishop of Armagh
●●

He visited Catholic schools.

However, one of his decisions was to build a new university in Coleraine, a mainly
Protestant town, rather than Derry/Londonderry, a mainly Catholic city.

Why were the 1960s important for North-South relations?
There were also changes in the South, where Lemass changed government policy in
relation to Northern Ireland. He believed that the best way to end the partition between
the North and the South was to make Southern Ireland more prosperous. He met
Terence O’Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, in Belfast and in Dublin in 1965.
These were the first official meetings between the leaders of the two states since partition
in 1920. However, by the end of the 1960s relations had worsened between North and
South as the Troubles began (see Ch. 26).

THE 1960S – An Important Decade in Irish History

25

Why were the 1960s important for relations between Catholics and
Protestants in Northern Ireland?
Tensions began to grow in Northern Ireland. More extreme unionists were worried
about O’Neill’s efforts to improve relations with Catholics. The Ulster Volunteer Force
(UVF) was formed in 1966, and a number of Catholics were killed. Rev. Ian Paisley,
leader of the Free Presbyterian Church, was one of those very critical of O’Neill’s efforts
to improve relations with Catholics.
Catholics were also disappointed with O’Neill – they thought he should be bringing
in more reforms. Catholics were still discriminated against in several areas.

Discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland
●●

The property qualification for voting in local elections meant that only property
owners could vote – this favoured Protestants

●●

There was gerrymandering in constituencies so that unionists controlled councils
in nationalist majority areas

●●

The allocation of houses by local councils favoured Protestants

●●

The allocation of jobs in the civil service and local councils favoured Protestants

The importance of Civil Rights
The disappointment of Catholics and nationalists led to the formation of the Northern
Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in 1967. This was inspired by the civil rights
movement in America. NICRA made the following demands:
●● ‘One man, one vote’ in local elections
●●

An end to gerrymandering

●●

An end to discrimination in jobs and housing.

There were marches and rioting in Derry and Belfast. In October 1968, a civil rights
march in Derry was stopped by the RUC. The television cameras captured the brutal
treatment of its leaders by the police. This shocked people in the rest of Ireland and
Britain.
The British government forced O’Neill and his government to bring in reforms in
housing and local elections. However, this did not stop the demonstrations. O’Neill
had to face opposition from extreme unionists, led by Ian Paisley, who demanded that
he should not give in to Catholics. O’Neill was forced to resign in 1969 when he lost
the support of his own party. The conflicts between nationalists and unionists got more
serious, and developed into the Troubles from the end of 1969 onwards (see p. 403).
