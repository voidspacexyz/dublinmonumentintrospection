What were the
Troubles?

The Troubles refers to the conflict which occurred
in Northern Ireland from the late 1960s to
1998. The conflict involved the unionist and
nationalist communities in the North.

MAKING HISTORY

22Define the
Troubles

It also involved their political representatives and various paramilitary groups on
both sides, as well as British security forces. It resulted in over 3,000 deaths, migration of
people and widespread destruction. It also involved the British and Irish governments in
trying to find a solution that would end the Troubles.

What were they all about?
The Troubles initially began with Catholic/nationalist demands for improved civil
rights. These were resisted by some unionists who felt that the demands would give
more power to nationalists and would undermine Northern Ireland. Demonstrations
and riots arose from clashes between nationalists and unionists (or Loyalists), and
the police. These led the British government to bring in the British army to protect the
nationalist community.
Paramilitary involvement in the conflict from both sides – the IRA on the nationalist
side, and the UVF (Ulster Volunteer Force) and UDA (Ulster Defence Association)
on the unionist side, dramatically increased the levels of violence. The IRA also went
beyond civil rights demands by looking for a united Ireland.

What Caused the Troubles?

The Troubles had both long-term and short-term causes. The long-term causes went
back to the British use of conquest and colonisation in Ireland in the 16th and 17th
centuries. The short-term causes were those which led to nationalist demands for reform
in Northern Ireland in the 1960s.

THE TROUBLES IN NORTHERN IRELAND

What were the long-term causes of the Troubles?
British conquest and colonisation
In the 16th and 17th centuries, the kings and queens
of England used war and plantation to conquer
Ireland.
They took land from the Gaelic and AngloNorman lords and gave it to Protestant planters
from England and Scotland. By the end of the 17th
century, the Protestant settlers controlled the land
and government of Ireland (see Ch. 8).

The struggle for independence
By the end of the 18th century, many people in
Ireland were calling for greater or full independence
from Britain (see Ch. 10). These nationalists formed
two different groups:
●● One group favoured the parliamentary
tradition. They wanted to achieve a separate
parliament for Ireland by peaceful means.
●●

The second group favoured the physical force
tradition. They wanted to achieve complete
separation or independence from Britain by
armed rebellion.

These were opposed by a third group, unionists. After the Act of Union in 1800,
which brought in direct rule in Ireland from the parliament in Westminster, unionists
wanted to maintain the unity of Britain and Ireland. The unionists were strongest in
Ulster.

and 17th centuries

that guaranteed the

in Ireland (see

By the early 20th century, two separate communities had grown up in Northern Ireland.

Partition
Between 1912 and 1920, unionists in the North of Ireland resisted all efforts to
force them into a Home Rule Ireland. By 1920, they had won their battle when the
Government of Ireland Act established a parliament in Belfast to deal with the internal
affairs of Northern Ireland. At the same time there were serious riots in Belfast in which
Catholics/nationalists suffered a greater number of deaths and injuries (See pp. 244–46).
From 1920 onwards, the unionists dominated the parliament of Northern Ireland
and controlled the area in their own interest.

What were the short-term causes of the Troubles?
Discrimination
One of the ways the unionists maintained power in Northern Ireland was by
discriminating against Catholics or nationalists. This happened in local government,
housing and jobs (see p. 408).

Gerrymandering
One example of discrimination was gerrymandering. In this process, unionists rigged
the votes so that areas with a Catholic majority still elected a majority of unionist
councillors to local government. The most blatant example of that was in Derry/
Londonderry. Unionists in gerrymandered councils controlled the allocation of houses
and jobs.

THE TROUBLES IN NORTHERN IRELAND

26

Civil Rights and the beginning of the Troubles
The disappointment of Catholics and nationalists led to the formation of the Northern
Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in 1967. This was inspired by the civil rights
movement in America (see pp. 374–376). NICRA made the following demands:
●● ‘One man, one vote’ in local elections.
●●

An end to gerrymandering.

●●

An end to discrimination in housing
and jobs.

Its leaders included Gerry Fitt, John
Hume, Austin Currie and Bernadette
Devlin. There were marches and
demonstrations, and rioting in Derry and
Belfast.
The Prime Minister, Terence O’Neill,
made efforts to improve relations with the
Catholics. Despite this, tensions began to
grow in Northern Ireland. More extreme
unionists were worried about O’Neill’s
efforts to improve relations with Catholics.
The UVF was formed, and a number of
John Hume, Austin Currie, Paddy O’Hanlon and Bernadette Devlin – leaders of
the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association
Catholics were killed.
On the other hand, Catholics were disappointed that O’Neill was not bringing in
more reforms. Catholics were still discriminated against in several areas. Divisions
between the two communities continued to grow.

The day the Troubles began
In October 1968, a civil rights march in Derry was stopped by the Royal Ulster
Constabulary (RUC). The television
cameras captured the brutal treatment
of its leaders by the police. This shocked
people in the rest of Ireland and in Britain.
The British Government forced O’Neill
to bring in reforms in housing and in
local elections, but this did not stop the
demonstrations. O’Neill also had to face
opposition from the extreme unionists,
led by Ian Paisley, who demanded that
he should not give in to Catholics. O’Neill
was forced to resign in 1969 when he
lost the support of his own party. He was
succeeded by Major James ChichesterBelfast people with belongings they have salvaged after being driven out of

Showdown on 5 October
After their first march on 24 August 1968 in County Tyrone
, NICRA were
invited by the Derry Housing Action Committee (DHAC
) to hold a march
in County Londonderry on 5 October. The Apprentice Boys
of Derry, a
Protestant society, announced plans to march the same
route, on the same
day. Northern Ireland’s Minister for Home Affairs, Willia
m Craig, responded
by issuing a banning order on all marches within the bound
aries of the
planned route.
On the day of the march, a few hundred civil rights protes
ters planned to
walk from Duke Street, in the predominantly Protestant
Waterside area
of Derry, to the Diamond in the centre of the city. Duke
Street had been
declared out of bounds by Craig’s order and marchers
were confronted by
rows of police officers from the RUC.
The police used batons and water cannons in an attem
pt to disperse the
marchers and violent skirmishes broke out. Among those
injured in the clash
were Gerry Fitt, a Republican Labour MP, and three (West
minster) Labour
MPs (Russell Kerr, Anne Kerr and John Ryan). Dramatic
images were captured
on camera by the media and broadcast around the world
.
Television news coverage of these events brought the
situation in Northern
Ireland to international attention and serious rioting broke
out locally.
More civil rights demonstrations and counter-demonstra
tions followed in
the weeks and months ahead, with many ending in clashe
s as the security
situation slipped out of control. … Eamonn McCann, one
of the organisers of
the (Derry) march, said that the thing he recalled most
in the aftermath of
the day was “the number of people who came up to me
and said, using the
exact phrase: ‘Things will never be the same again’. And
they were right.”

North-South relations
Relations between North and South improved during the 1960s (see p. 401). However,
tensions rose in the late 1960s as the Troubles began. Attacks by RUC and loyalist
paramilitaries on Catholic ghettos in Derry and Belfast resulted in nationalist
(Catholic) families moving south. It also resulted in a television address by Taoiseach,
Jack Lynch, where he said the Irish Government ‘could no longer stand by and see innocent
people injured’ (1969).
Relations worsened over the foundation of the IRA, unionist claims that the Irish
Government wasn’t doing enough to stop the IRA, and the events of Bloody Sunday
(1972).
The Irish Government believed that partition was the cause of the Troubles. However,
this view changed. Now the Irish Government wanted to see improved relations in
the North. It believed that the unification of the country would only come though the
consent (agreement) of the people.
Over the next 20 years, relations improved or
disimproved depending on events in Northern
Ireland. Relations also depended on the impact
of the Troubles on the South. However, gradually,
the Irish Government got a greater say in the
affairs of Northern Ireland through the attempts
at peacemaking – the Sunningdale Agreement,
the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Good Friday
Agreement.

The Troubles escalate
Violence increased from 1969 onwards. In August
of that year, major violence was sparked off by
the Protestant Apprentice Boys march in Derry. This march
led to a clash with the Catholics/nationalists of the Bogside
in Derry. The nationalists barricaded their area and resisted
efforts by unionists and the RUC to enter the area, in what
became known as the Battle of the Bogside. Petrol bombs
and stones were thrown at the RUC to keep them out of the
Bogside. The rioting spread to other parts of Northern Ireland.

Battle of the Bogside

British troops
By now, nationalists had lost all respect for the RUC. The
British Government sent in troops to protect the people of the
Bogside. Troops were also sent into nationalist areas of Belfast
after rioting broke out there. The people welcomed soldiers
with cups of tea.

MAKING HISTORY

The SDLP
The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) was founded in 1970. It brought
together different nationalist groups and became the largest nationalist party. Its first
leader was Gerry Fitt, and he was succeeded by John Hume. Hume was an example of
the parliamentary tradition in Irish politics.

John Hume

The IRA

The IRA (Irish Republican Army) was badly organised at this time. It split into two
groups: the Official IRA, which was moving away from violence, and the Provisional
IRA, which believed in the traditional use of physical force, to force Britain to withdraw
from Northern Ireland.
The Provisional IRA was set up with the encouragement
of members of the Southern Irish Government. Some
government money was used illegally to purchase
weapons for the ‘Provos’, as they became known later.
The IRA launched a bombing campaign in 1970,
which resulted in the deaths of many civilians; they also
targeted British soldiers and the RUC. The IRA also used
stone-throwing youths to attack the British soldiers who
responded with house searches. With these searches,
the British army lost the support of the nationalist
La Mon restaurant bombing in which an IRA bomb created
a massive fireball which killed 12 people and severely community.
injured about 30 more

Internment
As violence spread over the next couple of years, the unionist government of Brian
Faulkner, who had taken over from Chichester-Clark, decided to bring in internment.
This was the arrest and imprisonment without trial of people suspected of being
involved in violence. In August 1971, 342 people were arrested in night-time raids.
The operation was a disastrous failure.
(i) The government had poor intelligence about IRA leaders, so many innocent
people were arrested.
(ii) Only some leaders of the IRA were arrested;
the rest escaped internment.
(iii) There was widespread rioting and a huge
increase in support for the IRA.

Bloody Sunday

Bloody Sunday in January 1972 also increased
nationalist anger. On that Sunday, British soldiers
fired on an anti-internment march in Derry.
13 people were killed. There were widespread
protests and further rioting in Derry and Belfast. In
Dublin, a crowd attacked and burned the British
embassy.

Direct Rule from Britain
It was clear that the unionist
governments had failed to tackle the
problems of the North. More than 400
people had been killed in the four years
since 1969. The British Government
decided to suspend the government
and parliament of Northern Ireland.
Direct rule from Westminster was
brought in in 1972. William Whitelaw
was appointed the first Secretary of
State to govern the North. This was the
first time in 50 years that unionists did not rule Northern Ireland.

The Sunningdale Agreement
By 1973, a new Conservative government
in Britain drew up an agreement with the
Southern Irish Government. This was the
Sunningdale Agreement, signed by Edward
Heath, Prime Minister of Britain, and Liam
Cosgrave, Taoiseach. The agreement proposed
a power-sharing government in Northern
Ireland. Unionists and nationalists would rule
together.
The agreement also proposed a Council of
Ireland, which included representatives of the
Southern Government to organise cross-border
co-operation.
The new government was formed by the
Unionist Party and the SDLP, which
represented the majority of nationalists. It
was led by Brian Faulkner, the leader of the
Unionists, and Gerry Fitt of the SDLP.

The Ulster Workers’ Council strike

Ian Paisley speaking during the Ulster Workers’ Council Strike

Extreme unionists, led by Ian Paisley, were
very much opposed to sharing power with
nationalists. They also feared that the Council
of Ireland would lead to a united Ireland.
The Ulster Workers’ Council organised a
general strike in May 1974 to bring down the
power-sharing government. Electricity supplies
were cut and roads were blocked. This led to
the collapse of the power-sharing government.
The North returned to direct rule from
Westminster as the first effort to bring peace to
the North failed.

The hunger strikes
In 1979, Margaret Thatcher replaced Edward Heath as Conservative Prime Minister.
Very soon, she was faced with a major crisis. IRA prisoners in the H-Blocks of the
Maze Prison demanded political prisoner status – that is, they wanted to be treated
differently from criminal prisoners and allowed to wear their own clothes. When the
government refused this demand, some of them, led by Bobby Sands, went on hunger
strike.
The hunger strikes led to greater divisions between the two communities in the
North. They also led to widespread anti-British feeling in the South. The British
Government came under pressure to give in, but it did not. After sixty-six days, the first
hunger striker, Bobby Sands, died. Over the next few months, nine more hunger strikers
died. Then the Provisional IRA called off the hunger strike. The British Government
restored political prisoner status after this.
By now, the IRA was developing a strategy
of the ‘Armalite and the ballot box’. They
continued bombing and shootings, but
combined this with their political party, Sinn
Féin, contesting elections.

The Anglo-Irish Agreement, 1985
The governments in London and Dublin now feared
that Sinn Féin would gain support at the expense
of the SDLP. This allowed Garret Fitzgerald, then
Taoiseach, to persuade Margaret Thatcher that a new
agreement was needed. This was the Anglo-Irish
Agreement of 1985. It was signed by both leaders at
Hillsborough Castle, near Belfast. The agreement gave
the government of the Irish Republic a say in running
Northern Ireland.
Unionists believed that they were sold out by the
Unionist opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985
British Government and they were opposed to any
say by the Irish government in the affairs of Northern Ireland. In spite of very strong
unionist opposition to the agreement, the British and Irish governments refused to give
in. The agreement was a major step forward and formed the basis for progress towards
peace after that.

THE TROUBLES IN NORTHERN IRELAND

26

Peace moves after 1985
After 1985, many efforts were made to find a
solution to Northern Ireland’s problems. The
British and Irish governments worked to bring
all the Northern parties together. Many people in
Northern Ireland were longing for peace.
The Downing Street Declaration (1993) led to
an IRA ceasefire, though it broke down later. The
Declaration said there would be talks to discuss
a new form of government for Northern Ireland.
The British Government said that Irish unity was a
matter for the Irish people, subject to the consent
John Hume, leader of SDLP
David Trimble, leader of Ulster
Unionist Party
of the people of Northern Ireland.

everybody could support. This led to the Good Friday
Agreement.
The Good Friday Agreement (1998) created a power-sharing government that
included all political parties elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The agreement
also stated that Northern Ireland would remain part of the United Kingdom until a
majority both of the people of Northern Ireland and of the Republic of Ireland wished
otherwise.
Initially, the dominant unionist and nationalist parties in the Northern Government
were the Unionist Party and the SDLP. However, these were replaced after general
election results in the early 21st century by the Democratic Unionist Party on the
unionist side and by Sinn Féin on the nationalist side. These parties dominated
the power-sharing executive (government) in Northern Ireland until the executive
collapsed in January 2017. There are continuing negotiations to restore the executive.
