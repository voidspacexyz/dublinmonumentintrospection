Ireland in the Sixteenth
Century
In the 16th century, about 750,000 people lived
in Ireland. Most of the people lived in the
countryside. There were very few towns, and most
of them were small.
In the early 16th century, the King of England
was Lord of Ireland, but he had very little control
over the countryside. The Pale was the only part of
Ireland where the king’s officials had power.

Efforts to Conquer Ireland: Why the Land
Changed Hands

Henry VII came to power in England in 1485. This was the beginning of the reign of the
Tudor family. The Tudors continued to rule there until 1603. The descendants of Henry
VII – his son, Henry VIII, followed by Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I – took a close
interest in Ireland. By 1603, when Elizabeth died, the English Crown had conquered
Ireland.

Military conquest
During the 16th century, the Tudors extended their power beyond the Pale. In a series
of wars, they reduced the power and influence of the great Anglo-Irish lords, such as
the Fitzgeralds of Kildare and the Fitzgeralds of Desmond (Munster).
However, even though their use of the army was very successful, it was also very
expensive. Along with that, families could rise up again in later years, so military
conquest had its weaknesses.

A new policy: plantations
The English government decided to use another policy to conquer Ireland. This was
called plantation. This was how it worked:
●● After rebellious chiefs or lords were defeated, their lands
were confiscated (taken over)
●●

The land was given to loyal settlers, or ‘planters’

●●

The planters would use English law, language and customs

●●

The planters would defend their new land.

Where was the plantation policy tried?
The new plantation policy was first tried in two main areas:
●● Laois-Offaly
The Plantation of Laois-Offaly was very limited and it
was unsuccessful.
●● Munster
The Plantation of Munster was more extensive. Settlers or planters
came from England, new towns were established, and new farming
methods were introduced. A wealthy Protestant minority who
controlled large estates was established, but fewer planters came
than expected so overall, the plantation was a failure.

the Plantation

influenced
identity

The Plantation of Ulster
Background and causes
Gaelic society dominated Ulster. Gaelic chiefs and clans were the main rulers of Ulster.
The most powerful of these were the O’Neills of Tyrone and the O’Donnells of
Donegal.
In 1594, the Nine Years War began when the Ulster chiefs rebelled against efforts
by the English government to impose English law and the Protestant religion on the
province. The Ulster chiefs, led by Hugh O’Neill, Earl of Tyrone, won a number of
battles, including the Battle of the Yellow Ford. This encouraged other parts of the
country, including Munster, to rise in rebellion.

Spanish help
Philip II of Spain sent ships with 4,000 soldiers to help the rebellion. These ships
landed at Kinsale, Co. Cork but were surrounded by an English fleet and an English
army. When O’Neill and O’Donnell came to help, they were defeated at the Battle of
Kinsale in 1601.
Even though O’Neill made peace with the English government in the Treaty of
Mellifont (1603), the English government still harassed the Ulster chiefs and wanted to
force English law and control over them.

Flight of the Earls, 1607
In 1607, O’Neill and other Ulster chiefs fled Ireland to the continent. This event was
later called the Flight of the Earls. The English government under King James I declared
the leaders traitors and confiscated their land. He now intended to introduce loyal
planters to the area.

Reasons for the plantation
King James I wanted the plantation for a number of reasons:
●● He wanted to create a loyal and Protestant population.
●●

He wanted to protect England. He did not want other countries, such as Spain
and France, using Ireland as a base from which to attack England.

●●

He wanted to spread the Protestant religion in Ireland because he thought
Catholics would be disloyal to the Crown.

●●

He thought that English culture was superior to Irish Gaelic culture.

●●

He wanted to gain money for the Crown for rents and to pay soldiers and officials
who fought in the Nine Years War and organised the plantation.

The plan of plantation
Survey
Lands were confiscated in six counties – Derry, Donegal, Cavan, Tyrone, Fermanagh and
Armagh. A Commission of Inquiry visited the confiscated counties and investigated

the ownership of the land. A team
of surveyors, protected by soldiers,
travelled with them. The Commission
divided the land into two parts – crown
land (belonging to the king) and church
land (belonging to the Protestant
clergy). All church land was given to the
Church of Ireland and Trinity College,
Dublin. The crown land was used for
plantation and for towns and schools.

How successful was the Plantation?
From the point of view of the English government, the Ulster Plantation was more
successful than the plantations of Laois-Offaly or Munster.
(i) It increased the influence of English law, the English language and English farming
methods in Ulster
(ii) It ensured a loyal population
(iii) It spread the Protestant religion.

The New Population
The planters came from Scotland and England. They were either Presbyterians
(Calvinists) or Church of England (Anglican). They brought their own clergy, took over
Catholic churches and also built their own. By 1641, there were about 40,000 Scottish
and English settlers (planters) in Ulster.
In later years, large numbers of Scottish migrants continued the tradition of Scottish
settlement in Ulster; between 1690 and 1698, 80,000 Scottish people came to Ulster
due to famine in their own country.

THE PLANTATION OF ULSTER AND THE GROWTH OF TOWNS

08

Land and religion
The religion of the planters differed from that of the Gaelic Irish, who were Catholic.
The conflicts over land and religion led to mistrust and hatred between the native
Irish and the planters. In 1641, the native Irish attacked the planters in a rebellion and
massacred thousands of them. Up to 12,000 out of 40,000 Protestants in Ulster were
killed.

New towns
The planters introduced town life to Ulster.
More than 20 new towns were planned and
built. These included Derry/Londonderry
and Coleraine in Co. Derry, Letterkenny in
Co. Donegal and Dungannon and Strabane
in Co. Tyrone. They were laid out with
straight, wide streets. They had a central
square or diamond, where the courthouse
or church was built and markets were
held. The towns were surrounded by stone
walls. These towns became centres of local
government, and centres of business and
trade for the farming communities around
them.
The planned town of Donegal with the Diamond in the centre

Box-framed houses became popular during the
plantations as they were cheap and easy to build

The planters introduced a new style of architecture. Their houses were of the
English-style, while many castles and stone houses were based on Scottish
architecture, such as Enniskillen Castle, Co. Fermanagh.

MAKING HISTORY

The economy
The planters introduced new farming methods. They grew more crops and developed
the field system. This differed from the Gaelic Irish system, which depended more on
cattle and an open grazing system. Woods were cut down and the timber was exported.
Trade prospered and roads, inns and mills were developed.

KEY WORD
●● Culture: The beliefs,

customs and way of
life of a people.

The Gaelic Irish
Gaelic Irish tenants were given land by servitors and the ‘loyal Irish’. Some also got land
from the undertakers. Many Gaelic Irish therefore remained on the plantation estates.
Others took to the mountains and the woods and became known as ‘tories’ or outlaws.
From there they attacked the planters who feared that the ‘throats of the poor, dispersed
British’ would be cut.
The culture and language of the Gaelic Irish declined because the Gaelic chiefs lost
their power. The English language became more widespread during the 17th century.
Gaelic Brehon law was replaced by English common law.

Conflicts based on identity
The divisions between the Catholic Irish and the Scottish and English planters led to
further conflicts between them over the centuries.
●● After the 1641 Massacre and Rebellion, Cromwell sailed to Ireland in 1649 to
avenge the massacre of Protestants and to put down the rebellion. Very soon, he
and his generals had massacred Drogheda, conquered the country and imposed a
plantation, which favoured Protestant landowners.

See Chapter 26

●●

In 1688, Catholic King James II was ousted from the throne of England. His
Protestant daughter, Mary, and her husband, William of Orange, were crowned
instead. James came to Ireland to get support from Catholic leaders, and he besieged
the city of Derry/Londonderry. However, the garrison said, ‘No Surrender!’ The city
of Londonderry favoured William and 13 apprentice boys closed the gates against
an opposing army. The Siege of Derry lasted 105 days but ships broke through
and brought food to the people. The siege and action of the apprentice boys are
commemorated every year in Derry/Londonderry.

●●

In 1689, William’s army took on and defeated James’ army at the Battle of the
Boyne. William’s victory is commemorated every year on 12 July with parades and
festivities organised by the Orange Order in Northern Ireland.

The divisions between Catholics and Protestants contributed to sectarian rioting in
Belfast in the 19th century, conflicts between nationalists and unionists in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries, to the founding of Northern Ireland in 1920 and to conflict
over civil rights and the Troubles in Northern Ireland from the 1960s onwards.

HISTORICAL EMPATHY

p. 78 ❱

Symbols are very important for identity. Nationalists (mostly Catholics) and Unionists
(mostly Protestants) in Northern Ireland use symbols on their streets, in their
organisations and at their events which have a special meaning for them. Many of

Monastic towns in Early Christian Ireland were centres of Gaelic and Christian culture,
similar to the surrounding countryside. With the coming of the Vikings in the late 8th
century, towns developed a different culture to the surrounding countryside. At a later
stage, they became centres of Anglicisation (spreading of English language and culture)
in a largely Gaelic hinterland.

Early monastic towns
Some of the Early Christian monasteries in Ireland developed an urban or town
structure. Clonmacnaoise, for example, began as a monastery but outside the monastery
walls, trading functions developed. These towns maintained their religious identity as
their main characteristic (See pp. 40–44).

08

Vikings in 8th and 9th centuries
The first Vikings who came to Ireland raided
monasteries close to the coast or accessible
along rivers. Very soon, however, Vikings built
winter encampments in coastal locations.
These developed into towns. Dublin, Cork and
Waterford were examples of these. They built
embankments with timber walls (or palisades)
on top around the settlement for defence.
These towns connected with Viking trading in
Europe, they spoke Norse and introduced some
words such as margadh (market) into the Irish
language.

The Normans (or Anglo-Normans) developed
the existing Viking towns and added over 50
new towns of their own. The new towns were
built near monastic sites or castles, and on
rivers or along the coast. Examples included
Kilkenny, Trim, Athenry and Fethard. All the
Norman towns were given royal charters to
trade and collect taxes; they developed markets
and they built stone walls and erected gates.
Some spoke French, initially, but then the towns
became centres of English influence over time.
The towns differed from the Gaelic Irish in the
countryside in language, laws, customs and
economy.

Q

A key aspect of the new English policy of plantation
in the 16th century was the development of towns.
These became not only centres of trade for the local
area, they were also centres of administration, with
court houses, barracks and gaols.
In the Munster Plantation, some of these towns
developed existing settlements such as Mallow, and
Youghal, Co. Cork. But others such as Bandon, Co.
Cork were new towns.
Many new towns were developed in the Ulster
Plantation. These were planned towns with wide
streets and a central market area, or diamond, as it
was called. The towns were centres of English and
Scottish culture.
Over the centuries, Gaelic or native Irish people
came to live outside the walls of some of towns.
These suburbs were sometimes called ‘Irishtown’.

THE PLANTATION OF ULSTER AND THE GROWTH OF TOWNS

08

The eighteenth century
In the 18th century, some landlords developed estate towns. These were planned towns
with wide streets and a green area. The town was connected to the Big House of the
landlord at one end, and a Protestant church at the other end.
An example of these towns is Kenmare, Co. Kerry. The Earl of Shelbourne built it in
the 1770s. The wide streets crossed as an X, and the town had a market place, a mill, a
school and a gaol.

As the most important city in the country, Dublin experienced a changing identity over the centuries. From Viking
and Anglo-Norman to strongly English, it reflected the changing power structure in Ireland. By the late-19th
century, those of Gaelic or native Irish descent had taken over much of the power in the city.
