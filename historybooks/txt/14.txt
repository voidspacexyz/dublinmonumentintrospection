22Examine the

origins of the
GAA

Sport in the Nineteenth Century

The second half of the 19th century saw the birth of modern sport. Sport was shaped by
written rules and national organisations to suit the demands of urban society in Britain,
the US and the Continent. The growth of nationalism, the development of the railway
system and the spread of education also influenced sport development. These trends
also influenced the development of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in Ireland.

Foundation of the GAA
The Gaelic Athletic Association for the Preservation and Cultivation of National Pastimes
was founded at a meeting in Hayes Hotel, in Thurles, on 1 November 1884.
The inspiration for the founding of the GAA came from Michael Cusack. Clareborn Cusack ran a school or academy in Dublin for students sitting for the Civil
Service examinations. He took a keen interest in sport but he was opposed to the
existing organisation of athletics. He disliked the fact that they were largely confined
to ‘gentlemen’, and thereby excluded labourers, policemen and others. He also wanted
to include nationalists in the governing body of athletics. In relation to hurling in
particular, he wanted a standard set of rules, with a national organisation for national
sports.
Cusack got the help of Maurice Davin, a noted athlete. Davin was elected President
of the GAA at the first meeting in Thurles, and Cusack acted as one of the secretaries.
Archbishop Croke of Cashel, C. S. Parnell, leader of the Home Rule Party and Michael
Davitt, one of the leaders of the land campaign, accepted an invitation to become
patrons of the GAA.

The Impact of the GAA

The GAA as part of the cultural revival
The GAA was part of the cultural revival at the end of the 19 century in Ireland.
The cultural revival promoted all things Irish or Gaelic. It wanted to reduce English
influence in all aspects of Irish life. This was also emphasised by the Gaelic League
(founded in 1893) as both wanted to de-anglicise Irish society.
Not surprisingly, by the early years of the 20th century, many people were members of
both organisations.
As one historian of the GAA said:
th

impact of the
GAA on Irish life

‘By 1910 or so dual membership had become normal for the majority of athleticallyminded urban-based nationalists; for many of them their first contact with the GAA came
through their involvement in the League.’ (Marcus de Búrca)

MAKING HISTORY

How did the GAA spread?
The GAA had an immediate impact on Irish life. According to Cusack, it ‘swept the
country like a prairie fire’, as clubs were established in many counties. Clubs were
founded in Munster, Leinster and Connacht, and more slowly in Ulster. Some of the
more successful early events were athletics meetings, but gradually hurling and football
took over as the main interest of the GAA. The GAA athletics meetings, and hurling and
football matches drew large crowds. There was a rise in local pride as clubs, based on
parishes, played other clubs.

Trouble for the GAA
However, the GAA’s early years were also troublesome. First, Cusack was fired as
secretary due to personality clashes. There was also a disastrous tour to America in
1888 – the American Invasion – aimed at promoting Gaelic sports there, but which lost
money for the new Association. Then there was conflict between IRB/Fenian members
and Home Rulers, which resulted in a split in the Association.
The foundation of the GAA had already attracted the attention of the Irish
Republican Brotherhood (IRB or Fenians) as four of the seven who attended the
founding meeting in Thurles were Fenians. The IRB looked on the GAA as a cover for
training young men for any future rising.

Decline and revival

Hill 16 or Hill 60?

However, the involvement of the IRB led to a split in the Association. Some of the GAA
supported Parnell in his conflict with the majority of the Home Rule Party (see p. 214).
In 1891, when he died, 2,000 GAA men carrying hurleys draped in black marched in his
funeral to Glasnevin cemetery. These divisions between IRB and Home Rule supporters,
backed by the Catholic Church, led to a decline in the GAA, which lasted for about a
decade. The number of clubs fell from nearly 900 in 1890 to 118 in 1893.
By the early 20th century, a revival of the GAA was taking place. In spite of divisions,
All-Irelands were held every year except one. The first All-Irelands were held in 1887,
and apart from 1888, All-Irelands were held each year thereafter. The number of clubs
grew again after the decline of the 1890s. By 1901 the number of clubs had risen from
118 in 1893 to 411 in 1901, though still well short of nearly 900 in the late 1880s.

Croke Park
A major step in the expansion of the
GAA was the purchase of playing fields in
Jones Road, Dublin in 1913, which soon
became Croke Park, after Archbishop
Croke. This became the headquarters of
the GAA.
During the 20th century, the stadium
underwent a number of developments.
In 1915, a sloped terrace was developed
behind the goals. The Hogan Stand
was added in the 1920s and the Cusack
Stand in the 1930s. A new Hogan Stand
was built in the 1950s. The modern

The GAA and the Rising
The GAA was part of the separatist tradition, which was linked with the cultural revival.
Some believed that the revival of Gaelic culture could not be achieved without a fully
independent country. These men and women, who were involved in the GAA and the
Gaelic League, became involved in political activity.
There were also those who looked on the GAA as a cover for training young men for
a future rising. This Fenian or IRB involvement had resulted in the Special Branch of
the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) reporting on the activities of the GAA members
and clubs. GAA members took part in the centenary of the 1798 Rebellion. They also
opposed Royal visits to Ireland. The GAA banned members of the RIC from playing
GAA (1897), and it banned GAA members from playing or watching ‘foreign games’,
such as cricket, hockey, rugby and soccer (1905). As well as Parnell’s funeral, the GAA
was also involved in famous funerals such as that of James Stephens (1901) and John
O’Leary (1907), both Fenians.
It was not surprising that members of the GAA took part in the 1916 Rising, which
grew out of the separatist tradition and the cultural revival.

MAKING HISTORY

Spreading the GAA
Handball is one of the
four national sports.
The GAA helped to set
up the Irish Amateur
Handball Association in
1924. Handball has an
international dimension
as Irish players compete
against players from the
USA, Canada, Australia
and the UK, where the
sport was taken through
emigration. It is open to
both males and females.
Handball progressed in
the 1960s when indoor
courts were constructed.
It is not a popular
spectator sport.

Rounders is similar to baseball, and it is another of the
four national sports promoted by the GAA. It is played by
both males and females, and as a non-contact sport, it is
open to many people.

The GAA has maintained links between the Irish
Diaspora and the Irish in Ireland. The links between
Gaelic games and Irish emigrants in the USA and the
UK go back to the beginning of the GAA in the 19th
century. This continued through the 20th century.
Gaelic Park in New York, for example, became
a centre for Irish emigrants who went to watch
football and hurling matches on Sundays. The links
were maintained through visiting county teams
and All-Star selections. Modern emigration has
strengthened those links, and expanded them now
into Australia, Europe and Asia where GAA clubs have
sprung up. These links between the GAA and the Irish
Diaspora have helped tourism in the country.

Camogie and Ladies Football
Camogie and Ladies Gaelic football are run
independently of the GAA, but with its active
support.
The Camogie Association (Cumann Camógaíochta
na nGael) was founded in 1904 after a challenge
camogie match had taken place in 1903. The
inspiration for the development of camogie came
from the Keatings Branch of the Gaelic League, in
Dublin. The sport was developed from hurling.
Camogie spread gradually. By 1912, there were 22 clubs:
Dublin – 11; London – 2; Wexford – 3; Meath – 2; Louth – 3.
The first All-Ireland Championship was held in 1932.

THE IMPACT OF THE GAA ON IRISH LIFE

14

It took much longer before ladies football was
organised. The Ladies Gaelic Football Association
was founded in 1974 after a number of tournaments
were held in the years before that, and county boards
were set up in some counties. The first All-Ireland
championship was held that year. Both camogie and
ladies football have benefitted from coverage by TG4.
They have provided a Gaelic outlet for ladies to match
the men’s hurling and football. If they were absent,
more younger ladies would be playing soccer and
rugby as alternatives.

The impact of GAA Clubs
The GAA depended on a club and county structure. The local club was based on the
parish. Players grew up with their clubs and the clubs became the focus of matches on
Sundays. Competition between neighbouring clubs and counties provided a strong
motivation. Participation in games encouraged teamwork and discipline. Involvement
in the club at all levels helped blur class distinctions in the countryside.
Many priests were active in the administration of local clubs. This strengthened the
relationship between the GAA and the Catholic Church.
As the 20th century progressed, the club became the focus of social activity,
particularly in country areas. The club house often became the community centre for
meetings, dances and concerts.
All the activity relating to the club was voluntary – whether administering or
coaching, or maintaining the club grounds. It was also amateur as there were no
payments involved. Voluntary and amateur became important characteristics of GAA
life.
The structure of the GAA has encouraged and promoted democracy in Ireland.
Its decisions come through its clubs, county boards and annual congress. This has
consolidated the democratic (and parliamentary) tradition in the country.

How has the GAA ‘moved with the times’?
The impact of the GAA is partly explained by the way the organisation has ‘moved with
the times’: it has kept pace with changes in Irish society.
One example of that is the lifting of the Ban in Rule 27 on members playing in or
attending soccer, rugby, cricket and hockey matches. This Rule was deleted in 1971 and
it reflected a feeling that barriers in society should be brought down. It also reflected
a more inclusive society, which developed during the 1960s. It showed how well the
democratic process worked in the GAA.

The Troubles and Rule 21
The Troubles in the North made life difficult for the GAA there. The GAA played an
important role for nationalists in Northern Ireland. It allowed nationalists to express
their identity. Nationalists could meet through the GAA’s social activities.
Loyalists (extreme unionists) looked on the GAA as ‘a nursery school’ for republicans
and nationalists. Some GAA members were murdered by loyalist organisations, security
forces harassed its members and some of its grounds, in particular Crossmaglen, Co.
Armagh were taken over by them.

However, the Troubles also provided another example of the GAA moving with the
times. This occurred with the deletion of Rule 21, which banned members of the British
Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) from being members of the GAA. This
had been introduced in 1897 and it reflected the separatist thinking of the time. But
by 2001, there was a feeling that as the peace process progressed in the North, Rule 21
should be lifted to improve relations between nationalists and unionists.

Historic rugby match
The GAA also contributed to one of the most significant sporting events of the early
21st century – the use of Croke Park as the venue for the historic rugby match between
Ireland and England in 2007. To do this, the GAA had to amend Rule 42, which
banned the playing of foreign sports in GAA stadiums. The match itself was very
symbolic considering the events of Bloody Sunday in 1920, when 14 civilians were
killed by British forces while they attended a Gaelic football match between Dublin and
Tipperary in Croke Park (see p. 247). The holding of the rugby match in Croke Park
contributed to greater understanding between the two countries.

Maintaining Irish culture
The GAA continued the promotion of other aspects of Irish
culture such as the Irish language, songs and dances. The
GAA Club Manual encourages the promotion of Irish culture
and heritage. Its own Coiste na Gaeilge promotes the use of
the Irish language. In 1969, it set up Scór, a cultural contest
for both young and old, in céilí, singing and storytelling. The
competition was based on the club, county, provincial and
national structure of the GAA.
